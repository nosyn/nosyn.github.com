<h1 class="font-extrabold"># Hello, I'm Son Nguyen âœŒ</h1>
<br />
<h2 class="font-extrabold">## About me</h2>
<p>
  I'm a web developer and enthusiastic programmer who always love learning new technogy. I have been working at
  <span class="font-bold italic text-violet-500"> Plus One Robotics</span> based in San Antonio , TX since 2020. I find joy
  in creating efficient and scalable server-side solutions and have honed my skills in technologies such as
  <span class="font-bold italic text-green-500"> Node.js</span>,
  <span class="font-bold italic text-blue-500">Go</span>, and
  <span class="font-bold italic text-orange-500">Rust</span>. I have delivered a wide range of projects, ranging from
  complex database integrations to simple API connections. My goal is to build web applications that not only have a
  beautiful user interface, but also have a robust and secure back-end architecture. I am eager to continue my
  professional growth and contribute my skills to our team's success.
