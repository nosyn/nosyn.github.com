      <h2 className="font-extrabold">## About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a web developer and enthusiastic programmer who always love learning new technogy. I have been working at
        <span className="font-bold italic text-violet-500"> Plus One Robotics</span> based in San Antonio , TX since
        2020. I find joy in creating efficient and scalable server-side solutions and have honed my skills in
        technologies such as
        <span className="font-bold italic text-green-500"> Node.js</span>,
        <span className="font-bold italic text-blue-500">Go</span>, and
        <span className="font-bold italic text-orange-500">Rust</span>. I have delivered a wide range of projects,
        ranging from complex database integrations to simple API connections. My goal is to build web applications that
        not only have a beautiful user interface, but also have a robust and secure back-end architecture. I am eager to
        continue my professional growth and contribute my skills to our team's success.
